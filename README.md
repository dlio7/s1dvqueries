# s1dvqueries
This repo was created to host SentinelOne Deep Visibility hunting queries for SMBs with SentinelOne Complete licensing.

These queries are not fool-proof and can introduce false positives, so hunting back in time is highly recommended before creating rules based off of each query.

Any questions, please feel free to let me know, always happy to assist a fellow defender.
